                  As you update your home with new technology, remember to
                  update your home's electrical system. Today's homes use far
                  more electricity for electronics and appliances than they did
                  15 years ago. Older homes simply weren't designed to handle
                  the amount of energy we need today. This difference results in
                  blown fuses, tripped circuit breakers and flickering lights.
